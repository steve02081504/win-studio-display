# Lessons Learned

- When building Windows monitor tooling, never rely only on `PHYSICAL_MONITOR.szPhysicalMonitorDescription`; it can return generic labels. Always expose an index-based selector and attempt WMI friendly-name enrichment.
- For Apple Studio Display specifically, default to HID control (`VID_05AC`, `PID_1114`) instead of DDC/CI monitor APIs; generic PnP names are a symptom of using the wrong control path.
- When the user asks to "do the same in our script," implement the external project's core logic directly rather than wrapping/downloading their binary.
- Do not hardcode a single product/interface tuple for Apple displays; probe all Apple HID devices for brightness report support to handle new hardware revisions.
- During HID discovery, do not require read/write opens or HID attributes to always succeed; add zero-access open and path VID/PID fallback to avoid false "device not found" results.
- In PowerShell scripts that use `Add-Type`, guard against redefinition when users run the script repeatedly in the same session.
- For `Add-Type` collision fixes, use both a pre-check and a catch for "already exists" so false negatives in type detection do not break repeated runs.
- If `Add-Type` collisions persist across session reuse, generate unique helper type names per run and invoke them through a resolved `[type]` handle.
- For ps2exe-built apps, do not assume `$PSScriptRoot` is populated; resolve runtime paths using `System.AppContext.BaseDirectory` and other fallbacks.
- If the user requests a single-file EXE, embed dependency scripts at build time instead of shipping sidecar `.ps1` files.
- In EXE path fallbacks, never feed empty strings into `Join-Path`; sanitize normalized base paths (especially root-like values) before candidate expansion.
- When invoking an embedded scriptblock, do not pass CLI-like `"-Param"` tokens as string arrays; splat a named-parameter hashtable to avoid positional type-conversion errors.
