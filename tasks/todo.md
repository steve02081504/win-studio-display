# Task Plan

- [x] Design a minimal Windows GUI flow for brightness control backed by the existing CLI script.
- [x] Implement a PowerShell WinForms UI app with slider, refresh, and apply controls.
- [x] Add Windows launcher and an EXE build script (`ps2exe`) that outputs a distributable executable.
- [x] Update README with GUI usage and EXE build steps.
- [x] Make EXE runtime path resolution robust when `$PSScriptRoot` is empty.
- [x] Embed backend logic into the generated EXE so distribution is a single file.
- [x] Fix EXE startup path error caused by empty base-path candidate expansion.
- [x] Fix embedded backend invocation so named params are not mis-bound as positional args.
- [x] Add backend compatibility parsing for legacy positional `get -Index` token calls.
- [x] Run embedded backend via temp script file to guarantee parameter binding parity with external script execution.
- [x] Execute backend via child PowerShell process to guarantee CLI-equivalent argument parsing from EXE.
- [x] Force backend `-Value` to be passed as named CLI arg from UI child process.
- [x] Fix native-process argument splatting and add executed-command diagnostics to backend error output.
- [x] Update UI selector strategy to prefer serial targeting and avoid index-only routing for single-display setups.
- [x] Pass backend `-Command` as named argument in UI child-process invocation.
- [x] Ensure embedded backend variable lookup also checks local scope and remove stale sidecar backend after EXE builds.
- [x] Add user-visible error modal and temp log output with full backend command diagnostics.
- [x] Simplify UI backend invocation to direct script-path call with named splatted parameters.
- [x] Align UI backend invocation with literal CLI token order for set/get paths.
- [x] Verify script integrity (best-effort in current environment) and document results.

## Review

- Added `tools/studio-display-brightness-ui.ps1` with a simple WinForms UI (display picker, slider, refresh, +/-10, apply).
- Added `tools/studio-display-brightness-ui.cmd` launcher and `tools/build-ui-exe.ps1` to generate `dist/StudioDisplayBrightnessUI.exe` via `ps2exe`.
- Extended backend CLI with `-Index` targeting to support reliable UI selection.
- Updated `README.md` with GUI usage and EXE build instructions.
- UI backend discovery now checks multiple runtime base directories (including `System.AppContext.BaseDirectory`) to work from compiled EXE launches.
- EXE build now embeds backend script content directly into the compiled UI executable; no sidecar backend file is required.
- UI path discovery now ignores empty normalized paths and supports embedded backend variable lookup from both script and global scopes.
- UI backend calls now invoke the embedded script with explicit named parameters (hashtable splat), fixing `-Index` being cast into positional `Value`.
- Backend parser now accepts legacy positional `get -Index N` patterns and rewrites them to named index selection before validation.
- Embedded backend execution now materializes to a temp `.ps1` and invokes that path, eliminating scriptblock binding edge cases seen in the EXE.
- UI now invokes backend through a child `powershell.exe`/`pwsh.exe` process with explicit CLI args, matching real command-line behavior and avoiding in-runspace binding quirks.
- UI child-process invocation now passes `-Value` explicitly as a named argument for `set`, removing remaining positional parsing ambiguity.
- Native child-process invocation now uses variable-array splatting (`@nativeArgs`) and appends the exact executed command line when backend returns non-zero.
- UI now prefers `-Serial` targeting when available and only uses `-Index` if multiple unnamed displays exist, aligning behavior with successful CLI usage.
- UI child-process invocation now also passes backend `-Command` explicitly as named argument to remove command-position ambiguity.
- Embedded backend discovery now checks default/local scope in addition to script/global, and EXE build now deletes old `dist/studio-display-brightness.ps1` sidecars that could override intended behavior.
- UI now shows full backend errors in a dialog and logs them to `%TEMP%\studio-display-brightness-ui.log` for precise troubleshooting.
- UI backend calls now execute the backend script path directly with named splatted parameters, reducing host argument parsing edge cases.
- UI backend call construction now mirrors manual CLI token order (`set <value> ...`), matching the known-working command-line behavior.
- Runtime validation could not be executed in this environment because Windows PowerShell is unavailable; static review completed.
